# Stone Paper and Scissors Game

Welcome to the Stone Paper and Scissors Game project! This project provides a web-based implementation of the classic hand game "Stone, Paper, Scissors." Users can play against the computer, which randomly selects one of the three options.

## Project Overview

The Stone Paper and Scissors Game application allows users to play the game against the computer. The user selects their choice (stone, paper, or scissors), and the computer randomly selects its choice. The game then determines the winner based on the standard rules of the game.

## Features

- **User Choice**: Allows users to select stone, paper, or scissors.
- **Computer Choice**: The computer randomly selects stone, paper, or scissors.
- **Game Result**: Determines the winner based on the rules:
  - Stone crushes scissors
  - Scissors cut paper
  - Paper covers stone
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the user's and computer's scores.

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS for the web interface
- JavaScript for game logic

## How It Works

1. **User Selection**: The user selects stone, paper, or scissors.
2. **Computer Selection**: The computer randomly selects stone, paper, or scissors.
3. **Determine Winner**: The game determines the winner based on the user's and computer's choices.
4. **Display Result**: The result of the game (win, lose, or draw) is displayed along with updated scores.
